Description:
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a protocol used for
network management. The NET-SNMP project includes various SNMP tools:
an extensible agent, an SNMP library, tools for requesting or setting
information from SNMP agents, tools for generating and handling SNMP
traps, a version of the netstat command which uses SNMP, and a Tk/Perl
mib browser. This package contains the snmpd and snmptrapd daemons,
documentation, etc.

You will probably also want to install the net-snmp-utils package,
which contains NET-SNMP utilities.
